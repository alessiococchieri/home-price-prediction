# home-price-prediction
The aim of the project was to develop a machine learning model in order to correctly predict the prices of Banglore houses based on:
- sqare feet
- number of bedrooms
- number of bathrooms
- region

# Model
The model was developed by exploiting common python libraries such as Numpy and by using a Python Notebook. The final model has been then exported as a pickle file.

# Server
The server side has been developed by using Flask. It alloed to develop the web application easily.

# Client
A simple interface has been bulit using HTML, CSS and Javascript. It allows the user to test directly the app.

# Deployment
The app has been deployed on Heroku. Heroku lets you deploy a Flask app online for free. This is a fantastic option to test dev environments, to make SEO tests in Google Search Console or to make a python a public app to showcase your work without paying for hosting and for a domain name.

# Web Hosting
The app is hosted at the following link:
